All configuration files are located in the `benchmark <https://github.com/OPM/pyopmspe11/blob/main/benchmark>`_ folder.

.. note::
    A few weeks after the OPM Flow 2025.04 release, there was a PR that changed the command line parameters for
    `--partition-method` and `--edge-weights-method` (see `the PR <https://github.com/OPM/opm-simulators/pull/6264>`_). Then, the 
    .txt configuration files in the benchmark folder use the old format from the OPM Flow 2025.04 release, while the .toml 
    configuration files use the new naming after that PR.

To run the cases in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pyopmspe11 -i r4_Cart_1mm_capmax2500Pa.txt -o r4_Cart_1mm_capmax2500Pa -m all -g all -t 1 -r 280,1,120 -w 0.16666666666666666

As mentioned in the `CSP description <https://onepetro.org/SJ/article/29/05/2507/540636/The-11th-Society-of-Petroleum-Engineers>`_, using the maximum value of 2500 Pa instead of
95000 Pa does not significantly impact the results (comparing r1 and r2), and this choice also reduces the simulation time. In addition, the corner-point grid results (r3) compare 
very well to the fine-scale simulations (r4). Unfortunately, the fine-scale simulation with stricer tolerances (r5) finished after the benchmark submission deadline; nevertheless,
we include it here for comparison to the other cases. While the case with stricter tolerances (r5) improves the mass issue compared to the previous case (r4), the simulation time 
increased, which highlights the trade-off between simulation time and accuracy (i.e., which is relevant for optimization studies which require to run many simulations).

* r1_Cart_10m

* r4_Cart_1m    
    Uniform grid of 1 m size
 
To run the cases in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pyopmspe11 -i r1_Cart_10m.txt -o r1_Cart_10m -m all -g all -r 840,1,120 -t 5 -w 0.1
    pyopmspe11 -i r2_cp_10mish.txt -o r2_cp_10mish -m all -g all -r 840,1,120 -t 5 -w 0.1

    pyopmspe11 -i r4_Cart_1m.txt -o r4_Cart_1m -m all -g all -r 840,1,120 -t 5 -w 0.1

For the box A quantities, the convective model results (r3) compare very well to the fine-scale simulations (r4), which runs ca. 500 times faster. Details on the convective model
can be found in `Mykkeltvedt et al. (2025) <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11242-024-02141-5>`_. For the implementation in OPM Flow of this model, it is work in progress to handle better the zones in the geological model where 
dissolve CO2 accumulates.

To run the case with more than 100 million cells (r4), it required improvements in the OPM Flow simulator (e.g., `METIS support <https://github.com/OPM/opm-grid/pull/738>`_), as well as in the **pyopmspe11** pre- and postprocessing functionality
(and of course a big computer, the `NORCE <https://www.norceresearch.no>`_ HPC cluster). See `this gif <https://github.com/OPM/pyopmspe11/blob/main/docs/text/figs/pyopmspe11c100Mcells.gif>`_ for visualization in `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org>`_ of the CO2 molar fraction (liquid phase) over time.

Well 1 correction

In the submitted results for SPE11C, the Well 1 was located ca. 100 m above the 300 m depth specified in the benchmark. The results belowed show the 
sparse data with the correct location of the well (results without dispersion on the reporting grid (r5, generated by setting DISP to 0 in r1) are showed instead of the large model (r4)).
