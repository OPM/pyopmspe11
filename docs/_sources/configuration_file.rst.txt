Configuration file
******************

In the initial development of **pyopmspe11**, the adopted configuration file format was the
one described below, i.e., via :ref:`txt` files. The current development of **pyopmspe11** considers
:ref:`toml` files. To keep compatibility with previous configuration files and Python versions of at least 3.8, 
then support for :ref:`txt` files will be kept, while new features will by added using :ref:`toml` configuration 
files (which requires at least Python3.11).

.. _txt:

===
txt 
===

The first input parameter in the configuration file is:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    """Set the full path to the flow executable and flags"""
    flow --enable-tuning=true --enable-opm-rst-file=true --output-extra-convergence-info=steps,iterations

If **flow** is not in your path, then write the full path to the executable
(e.g., /Users/dmar/opm/build/opm-simulators/bin/flow). We also add in the same 
line as many flags as required (see the OPM Flow documentation `here <https://opm-project.org/?page_id=955>`_).

.. note::
    If you have installed flow with MPI support, then you can run the simulations in
    parallel by adding **mpirun -np N flow ...** where N is the number of cpus.

.. tip::
    By executing flow -h you get an overview of the available flags in the
    flow simulator to improve/fix convergence and mass issues (i.e., by setting the flag \-\-linear-solver=cprw to change the linear solver,
    by tightening the cnv tolerances (\-\-tolerance-cnv), etc.).

----------------------------
Reservoir-related parameters
----------------------------

The following input lines in the configuration file are:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 4

    """Set the model parameters"""
    spe11c master     #Name of the spe case (spe11a, spe11b, or spe11c) and OPM Flow version (master or release)
    complete gaswater #Name of the co2 model (immiscible, convective, or complete) and co2store implementation (gaswater or gasoil [oil properties are set to water internally in OPM flow])
    corner-point      #Type of grid (cartesian, tensor, or corner-point)
    8400 5000 1200    #Length, width, and depth [m]
    420               #If cartesian, number of x cells [-]; otherwise, variable array of x-refinment
    30,40,50,40,30    #If cartesian, number of y cells [-]; otherwise, variable array of y-refinment [-] (for spe11c)
    5,3,1,2,3,2,4,4,10,4,6,6,4,8,4,15,30,9 #If cartesian, number of z cells [-]; if tensor, variable array of z-refinment; if corner-point, fix array of z-refinment (18 entries)
    70 36.12          #Temperature bottom and top rig [C]            
    300 3e7 0.1       #Datum [m], pressure at the datum [Pa], and multiplier for the permeability in the z direction [-] 
    1e-9 2e-8         #Diffusion (in liquid and gas) [m^2/s]
    8.5e-1 2500       #Rock specific heat and density (for spe11b/c)
    0 5e4 1           #Added pore volume on top boundary (for spe11a [if 0, free flow bc]), pore volume on lateral boundaries, and width of buffer cell [m] (for spe11b/c)
    150 10            #Elevation of the parabola and back [m] (for spe11c) 

In line 5 you specify if you are using OPM Flow from the master branch or from the latest stable release (OPM-flow 2024.04 release).
This since there are continuous changues in the OPM master branch. Then we 
will keep updating the decks for using Flow from master and also we will keep the framework to produce decks compatible for the latest OPM stable release.
The immiscible model allows for faster prototyping while the complete model includes dissolution of the components in the
gas and liquid phases, in addition to thermal effects. The convective model requires a Flow version newer than 22-08-2024; details on the model and keyword can be found in this `link <https://github.com/OPM/opm-simulators/pull/3076>`_. 
Regarding the grid type, the cartesian mode generates an uniform grid
with the defined number of elements in lines 9 to 11. The tensor grid allows to define arrays in each direction where the grid
is first divided with the number of entries in the array, and after it divides each of these elements by the assigned number in 
the array entry. The corner-point mode generates a grid where the x and y direction are defined as in the array mode, but the 
cell faces in the z-direction follows the lines as defined in the `lines_coordinates.geo <https://github.com/OPM/pyopmspe11/blob/main/src/pyopmspe11/reference_mesh/lines_coordinates.geo>`_ script,
resulting in 18 levels. Then, the z-refinment in each of these levels is set. See the configuration files in the `tests <https://github.com/OPM/pyopmspe11/blob/main/tests>`_ and 
`examples <https://github.com/OPM/pyopmspe11/blob/main/examples>`_ folder for the setting of these grids.
