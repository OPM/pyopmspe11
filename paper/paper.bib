abstract = {The Open Porous Media (OPM) initiative is a community effort that encourages open innovation and reproducible research for simulation of porous media processes. OPM coordinates collaborative software development, maintains and distributes open-source software and open data sets, and seeks to ensure that these are available under a free license in a long-term perspective. In this paper, we present OPM Flow, which is a reservoir simulator developed for industrial use, as well as some of the individual components used to make OPM Flow. The descriptions apply to the 2019.10 release of OPM.}

abstract = "{This article contains the description of, and call for participation in, the 11th Society of Petroleum Engineers Comparative Solution Project (the 11th SPE CSP, https://spe.org/csp). It is motivated by the simulation challenges associated with CO2 storage operations in geological settings of realistic complexity. The 11th SPE CSP contains three versions: Version 11A is a 2D geometry at the laboratory scale, inspired by a recent CO2 storage forecasting and validation study. For Version 11B, the 2D geometry and operational conditions from 11A are rescaled to field conditions characteristic of the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Finally, for Version 11C, the geometry of Version 11B is extruded to a full 3D field model. The CSP has a two-year timeline, being launched at the 2023 SPE Reservoir Simulation Conference and culminating at the 2025 SPE Reservoir Simulation Conference. A community effort is run in parallel to develop utility scripts and input files for common simulators to lower the threshold of participation; see the link to supplementary material on the CSP website. At the time of writing, complete input decks for one simulator are already ready for all three versions.}",

@article{Flemisch:2024,
abstract = {Successful deployment of geological carbon storage (GCS) requires an extensive use of reservoir simulators for screening, ranking and optimization of storage sites. However, the time scales of GCS are such that no sufficient long-term data is available yet to validate the simulators against. As a consequence, there is currently no solid basis for assessing the quality with which the dynamics of large-scale GCS operations can be forecasted. To meet this knowledge gap, we have conducted a major GCS validation benchmark study. To achieve reasonable time scales, a laboratory-size geological storage formation was constructed (the ``FluidFlower''), forming the basis for both the experimental and computational work. A validation experiment consisting of repeated GCS operations was conducted in the FluidFlower, providing what we define as the true physical dynamics for this system. Nine different research groups from around the world provided forecasts, both individually and collaboratively, based on a detailed physical and petrophysical characterization of the FluidFlower sands. The major contribution of this paper is a report and discussion of the results of the validation benchmark study, complemented by a description of the benchmarking process and the participating computational models. The forecasts from the participating groups are compared to each other and to the experimental data by means of various indicative qualitative and quantitative measures. By this, we provide a detailed assessment of the capabilities of reservoir simulators and their users to capture both the injection and post-injection dynamics of the GCS operations.},

abstract = {This paper summarises the results of a benchmark study that compares a number of mathematical and numerical models applied to specific problems in the context of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in geologic formations. The processes modelled comprise advective multi-phase flow, compositional effects due to dissolution of CO2 into the ambient brine and non-isothermal effects due to temperature gradients and the Joule--Thompson effect. The problems deal with leakage through a leaky well, methane recovery enhanced by CO2 injection and a reservoir-scale injection scenario into a heterogeneous formation. We give a description of the benchmark problems then briefly introduce the participating codes and finally present and discuss the results of the benchmark study.},
